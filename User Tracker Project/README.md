# User Tracker
this is a basic user tracker app, created using the MERN stack as a way to learn the new technology

## Tech Stack
These are the technologies used when creating this:

1. MongoDB
2. Node.js
3. React.js
4. Express.js

## How it works
it is pretty intuitive but there is a form on the right where you can insert users. First name, lastname, and email. all of this will be stored in the mongodb and so it can be accessed when you refresh the page. On the left there is a table where you can see what users are currently implemented into the database. 

## How to set it up
Make sure to run both the front end and the back end. To run the front end, cd into client, then project and type in the terminal npm run dev. For the backend, cd into server and in the terminal, run npm start. You will probably need to set up a mongodb and connect it to the backend. You can do that by creating an account and pasting in the connection link into the env file, under URI. The one I set up was something random so it may not work when someone else were to test it.

NOTE: you will need to run two terminals at once, one for front end and one for back end
